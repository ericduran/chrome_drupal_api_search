## Drupal API Search from Chrome Omnibox ##

------
This is a chrome extension that allows you to search Drupal API using chrome Omnibox.

This extension required a DEV version of Chrome with the "experimental" flag turn on.

If you are running a DEV version of Chrome with the "experimental" flag turn on you can search the Drupal API by using the d6 keyword.

Currently I'm using Lullabot's api because I preferred them but it can easily be switch to be api.drupal.org or drupalcontrib.org

TODO:
 - Allow configuration of what api the extension should use.
 - Add support for d7 (omnibox only support one keyword, so we'll need to have 2 extensions :-/ )
