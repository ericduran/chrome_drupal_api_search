## Drupal API Search from Chrome Omnibox ##
- - -
###Directions###
This extension required a Beta version of Chrome.

###Info###
Currently I'm using Lullabot's api because I preferred them but it can easily be switch to be api.drupal.org or drupalcontrib.org or your own api site.

####TODO####
- Allow configuration of what api the extension should use.
- Add support for d7 (omnibox only support one keyword, so we'll need to have 2 extensions :-/ )
