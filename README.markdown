## Drupal API Search from Chrome Omnibox ##
- - -
###Directions###
This extension required a BETA version of Chrome.

###Info###
Currently I'm using Lullabot's api because I preferred them but there's also a good reason behind it. So apparently the api module changed the way it looks up functions.
Before it would do an request as you type, but now it caches all the functions which is better but it's harder for me to figured out the url to get the list of functions.
Sadly when Lullabot updates their api site this will break, but for now I'll be working on supporting all three sites (api.drupal.org, api.drupalcontrib.org and api.lullabot.org).
